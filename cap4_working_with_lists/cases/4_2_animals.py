#4-2. Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common char- acteristic . Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal .
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'horse', 'fish']
for animal in animals:
    print("A " + animal + " would make a great pet.")

#Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common . You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
print("\nAny of these animals would make a great pet!")
