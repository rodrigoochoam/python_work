#Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
#Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one ortwo of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
#Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.

current_users = ['rodrigo', 'carlos', 'antonio', 'Ã¡lvaro', 'pablo']
