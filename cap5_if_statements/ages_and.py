ages_0 = 22
age_1 = 18

if ages_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

#First, we define two ages, age_0 and age_1. Then we check whether both ages are 21 or older 1. The test on the left passes, but the test on the right fails, so the overall conditional expression evaluates to False.
