#3-8. Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit .

#Store the locations in a list . Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order .
places_to_visit = ['praga', 'oslo', 'copenhague', 'hamburgo', 'florencia', 'moscow']

#Print your list in its original order . Don’t worry about printing the list neatly, just print it as a raw Python list .
print(places_to_visit)

#Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list .
print(sorted(places_to_visit))

#Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it .
print(places_to_visit)

#Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without chang- ing the order of the original list .
print(sorted(places_to_visit, reverse=True))

#Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again .
print(places_to_visit)

#Use reverse() to change the order of your list . Print the list to show that its order has changed .
places_to_visit.reverse()

print(places_to_visit)   

#Use reverse() to change the order of your list again . Print the list to show it’s back to its original order .
places_to_visit.reverse()

print(places_to_visit)

#Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order . Print the list to show that its order has been changed .
places_to_visit.sort()

print(places_to_visit)

#Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order . Print the list to show that its order has changed .
places_to_visit.sort(reverse=True)
